            Text Showing the importance of booking hotel from Hotel Booking-Bt like
            Many hotels and especially vacation rentals don’t have a complete website.
            They make a generic site and fill it with inadequate information. And most importantly, the Booking Systems that they use are way difficult to understand. 
            And that’s why guests prefer Hotel booking-bt over those hotel-website.
            Because Booking. com provides them with a simple Reservation System along with detail information.
            In fact, this is the one key reason why people love to use all those OTA sites, even though it costs them a higher fees.
